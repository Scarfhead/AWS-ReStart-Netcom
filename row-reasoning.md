# Why Do Tables Need Rows?
## Question 1: Why might you need to Insert Rows into Existing Tables.
Vital Information may be missing from existing table, which in turn requires data be inserted.

## Question 2: To Insert Information about Brazil into a Table concerning Countries, you could use the following code:

***INSET INTO country ('Code'= BSA,
'Name' = Brazil,
'Continent' = South America
'Region' = South America,
'Surface Area' = 8,547,403.00 );***
